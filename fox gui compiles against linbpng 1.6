fox gui compiles against linbpng 1.6

--------------------------
In the latest releases, 1.5 and newer, the png library disabled direct
access to its structure members. One is supposed to use the accessor
functions now.
The attached patch (against 2.1, but seems to be still needed looking at the online repository a few minutes ago) fixes the issue.
--------------------------

code change--->
png_ptr->jmpbuf -> png_jmpbuf(png_ptr)
