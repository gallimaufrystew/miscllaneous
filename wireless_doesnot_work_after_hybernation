after serveral days of running, especially after waking 
up from hybernation, the wireless connection was lost. 
ifconfig command shows that wireless interface was gone. 
several attempts of restarting wpa_supplicant 
and dhcpcd, but to no avail, it seems that 
the interface will never be DHCP-assigned...
finally, by brutally unloading wireless kernel 
module first(modprobe -r rtlwifi8192se)
and then load it again (modprobe rtlwifi8192se)

everything is ok...

i don't know whether compiling wireless module into kernel 
can fix this issue or not...
