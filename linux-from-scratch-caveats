caveat: 
   compiling process requires lots of patience,you'd better taking a sleep
   
1  with PDF version of Linux From Scratch
   a lot of command can't be copy and paste directly
   they are needed to format properly
   before executing any command,make sure it is in correct syntax and 
   wanted semantics

2 every time,delete previously used source directory 
  and start with a fresh one

3 make sure that the downloading of a list of files are all succeed

4 locale supported by kernel,glibc?

5  NIC may rely on firmware to work correctly for example,realtek  8192se
   wpa_suppliccant collides with tnetwork manager,two wpa_supplicant 
   process is running after installing networkmanager 
   disable network-manager

6 after the basic system was ready,rechroot command is different from previously used 

7 In several cases Xlib  expects that the character map will be listed in 
  uppercase notation with canonical dashes.

  The “C” (default) and “en_US” (the recommended one for United States English users) 
  locales are different. /* “C” uses the US-ASCII 7-bit character set */, and treats bytes 
  with the high bit set as invalid characters. That's why, e.g., the ls command 
  substitutes them with question marks in that locale. Also, an attempt to send 
  mail with such characters from Mutt or Pine results in non-RFC-conforming messages 
  being sent (the charset in the outgoing mail is indicated as “unknown 8-bit”). 
  So you can use the “C” locale only if you are sure that you will never need 8-bit characters.

  *UTF-8 based locales are not supported well by some programs.
  
  8 making sure needed drivers are compiled and load successfully
  
  9 device management==?
  
  10 understanding the linux destktop? xorg <--> desktop
