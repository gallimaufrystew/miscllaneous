Indicates if a socket created for the AF_INET6 address family is restricted to IPv6 communications only. Sockets created for the AF_INET6 address family may be used for both IPv6 and IPv4 communications. Some applications may want to restrict their use of a socket created for the AF_INET6 address family to IPv6 communications only.
When this value is nonzero (the default on Windows), a socket created for the AF_INET6 address family can be used to send and receive IPv6 packets only.

When this value is zero, a socket created for the AF_INET6 address family can be used to send and receive packets to and from an IPv6 address or an IPv4 address. Note that the ability to interact with an IPv4 address requires the use of IPv4 mapped addresses.
